### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Rate Limiting

#### Low Quality Results
- **Symptom**: Few posts with high relevance scores
- **Solution**: Adjust keywords in `production-config.json`
- **Optimization**: Add industry-specific subreddits

#### Large File Sizes  
- **Symptom**: CSV files >50MB
- **Solution**: Increase `minRelevanceScore` to filter more aggressively
- **Alternative**: Use JSON output for programmatic processing

#### Network Timeouts
- **Symptom**: Frequent timeout errors
- **Solution**: Increase `timeoutMs` in config
- **Workaround**: Run during off-peak hours

### Performance Optimization

#### For High-Volume Scraping
```json
{
  "scraping": {
    "requestDelay": 1500,
